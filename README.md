For nwHacks2017

## Inspiration
Saltbae has become one of the most trending memes on the internet. 

## What it does
Players enter game and shakes salt onto food (either by clicking 'shake' button or shaking a touch screen laptop). Players can then choose when to serve when they think they have reached the unknown optimal saltiness level. Depending on how close players are to a randomly generated saltiness level, tips are rewarded. Players can visit the store to buy power ups, as well as level up. 

## How we built it
We built the web application using Node.JS, express, and used cockroachDB to store high scores. We also used HTML, CSS for front end development and javascript to design game mechanisms. 

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenges were setting up the cockroachDB in order to store the players' ratings on a leaderboard. Some other challenges include getting Saltbae to level up with fancier food as he earns more tips.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Through our hard work, salt bae is able to level up with more tips, and acquire a higher than ever salt speed to impress the customers.

## What we learned
We learned that a fun game can be made with hard work, just like how a tasty dish can be made with more salt.

## What's next for Saltbae
We will add customers including but not limited to CASSSH ME OUSSSIDE, giving Saltbae more challenges as he aims to fulfill customers' demands with the optimal level of salt and also clean up the front end development.
